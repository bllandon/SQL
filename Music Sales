Below you will find some example queries I ran on a dataset comprosed on data such as product info, invoice info, and employee information.

-- Show Customers (their full names, customer ID, and country) who are not in the US.
SELECT FirstName, LastName, CustomerID, Country
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE Country <> 'USA';

--Show only the Customers from Brazil.
SELECT *
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE Country = 'Brazil';

--Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil.
SELECT FirstName, LastName, Invoiceid, InvoiceDate, BillingCountry
FROM chinook.invoices
JOIN chinook.customers ON chinook.customers.Customerid=chinook.invoices.Customerid
WHERE BillingCountry='Brazil';

-- Show the Employees who are Sales Agents.
SELECT *
FROM chinook.employees
WHERE Title = 'Sales Support Agent';

--Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the Invoice table.
SELECT Distinct BillingCountry
FROM chinook.invoices;

--Show the invoices associated with each sales agent. 
SELECT emp.FirstName, emp.LastName, inv.Invoiceid 
FROM chinook.employees AS emp
JOIN chinook.customers ON chinook.customers.SupportRepID=emp.Employeeid
JOIN chinook.invoices AS inv ON inv.Customerid=chinook.customers.Customerid;

--Show the Invoice Total, Customer name, Country, and Sales Agent name for all invoices and customers.
SELECT cust.FirstName, cust.LastName, cust.Country, emp.FirstName, emp.LastName, inv.Total
FROM chinook.invoices AS inv
JOIN chinook.customers AS cust ON cust.Customerid=inv.Customerid
JOIN chinook.employees AS emp ON emp.Employeeid=cust.SupportRepid;

--How many Invoices were there in 2009?
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM chinook.invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2009-12-31';

--What are the total sales for 2009?
SELECT ROUND(SUM(Total),2)
FROM chinook.invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2009-12-31';

--Show the purchased track name with each invoice line ID.
SELECT tracks.Name, invit.InvoiceLineId
FROM chinook.tracks
JOIN chinook.invoice_items AS invit ON invit.Trackid=tracks.Trackid;

--Show the purchased track name AND artist name with each invoice line ID.
SELECT t.Name AS Song_Title, art.Name AS Artist_Name, invit.InvoiceLineId AS Line_ID
FROM chinook.invoice_items AS invit
LEFT JOIN chinook.tracks AS t ON t.Trackid=invit.Trackid
INNER JOIN chinook.albums AS alb ON alb.Albumid=t.Albumid
LEFT JOIN chinook.artists AS art ON art.Artistid=alb.Artistid;

--Show all the Tracks, and include the Album name, Media type, and Genre.
SELECT t.Name AS Song_Title, alb.Title AS Album_Name, m.Name AS Media_Format, g.Name AS Genre
FROM chinook.tracks AS t
JOIN chinook.albums AS alb ON alb.Albumid=t.Albumid
JOIN chinook.media_types AS m ON m.MediaTypeid=t.MediaTypeid
JOIN chinook.genres AS g ON g.Genreid=t.Genreid;

--Show the total sales made by each sales agent.
SELECT emp.FirstName, emp.LastName, ROUND(SUM(inv.Total),2) AS 'Total Sales'
FROM chinook.employees AS emp
JOIN chinook.customers AS cust ON cust.SupportRepid=emp.Employeeid
JOIN chinook.invoices AS inv ON inv.Customerid=cust.Customerid
WHERE emp.Title = 'Sales Support Agent'
GROUP BY emp.FirstName; 

--Which sales agent made the most dollars in sales in 2009? 
SELECT emp.FirstName, emp.LastName, ROUND(SUM(inv.Total),2) AS 'Total Sales'
FROM chinook.employees AS emp
JOIN chinook.customers AS cust ON cust.SupportRepid=emp.Employeeid
JOIN chinook.invoices AS inv ON inv.Customerid=cust.Customerid
WHERE emp.Title = 'Sales Support Agent'
AND inv.InvoiceDate LIKE '2009%'
GROUP BY emp.FirstName
ORDER BY ROUND(SUM(inv.Total),2) DESC LIMIT 1;
